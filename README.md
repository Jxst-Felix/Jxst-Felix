# Welcome to my README.md

I'm Felix,
Currently busy with my school works and thesis.



I don't have time to make this README.md fancy just yet but I'll eventually come back and update my README.md with a better entry on it.

Some of my favorites are Pokemon BW/B2W2, PMD Explorers, MMBN series, and OMORI.
